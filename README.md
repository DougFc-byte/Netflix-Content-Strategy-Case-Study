# Netflix Content Strategy: Case Study

The goal of this project to explore a dataset that consists of Netflix content from 2023 with attributes such as content type, release season, language, and release day.  The goal of this project is to analyze the content strategy and understand how the different variables affect viewership patterns. It was suggested by Nisha Aria on [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/4-data-analytics-project-to-impress-your-next-employer).

## The Dataset

The dataset consists of Netflix content released globally in 2023 and allows exploration of patterns in viewership based on various attributes like content type, release season, language, and release day. The viewership data, represented in hours viewed, serves as a proxy for the popularity and audience engagement of each title. It can be downloaded [here](https://statso.io/netflix-content-strategy-case-study/).

## The Problem
The problem presented is to analyze Netflixâ€™s content strategy to understand how various factors like content type, language, release season, and timing affect viewership patterns. By identifying the best-performing content and the timing of its release, the aim is to uncover insights into how Netflix maximizes audience engagement throughout the year.

### The Tools

I have decide to use Colab for this project.
